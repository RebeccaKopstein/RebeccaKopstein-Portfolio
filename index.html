      <p>I had over 10 years of experience in the education field with a BS in Early Childhood Education. Then, two years ago, my interest was piqued when I stumbled across Udemy. I started by taking introductory courses in HTML and CSS—  at that point I was hooked!  In August 2018, I decided to take an exciting turn with my career goals by enrolling at UNCC, where I earned a full-stack web development certificate. During that time, I quickly found my passion for the initial design as well as creating what the websites will become after collaborations with great teams! While I have experience working with many different programming languages (all listed in my resumé) I also have knowledge in working with design and framework tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Balsamiq, Bootstrap, and Sketch. </p> 
      <p> I absolutely cannot wait to jump into the corporate world to implement my skills while working alongside outstanding coworkers with a company in Charlotte or the surrounding areas. </p> </p>
