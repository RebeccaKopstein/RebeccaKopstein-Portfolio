      <p>I have over 10 years of experience in the education field with a BS in Early Childhood Education. Then, two years ago my interest was piqued when I stumbled across Udemy. I started by taking introductory courses in HTML and CSS at that point I was hooked!  In August 2018, I decided to take an exciting turn with my career goals by enrolling at UNCC, where I earned a full-stack web development certificate.  </p> <p>During that time,  I quickly found my passion for the initial design and creating what the websites will become after collaborations with a great team!  While I have experience working with many different programming languages (all listed in my resum) I also have knowledge in working with design and framwork tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Balsamiq, Bootstrap, and Sketch.  I absolutely cannot wait to jump into the corporate world to implement my skills while working alongside outstanding coworkers with a company in Charlotte or the surrounding areas.
