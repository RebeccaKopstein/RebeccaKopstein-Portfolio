      <p>I have over 10 years of experience in the education field with a BS in Early Childhood Education; However, I have recently decided to take an exciting turn with my career goals. In August 2018, I earned a full-stack web development certificate from the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.  During my time learning to code I quickly found my passion for the initial designing and creating what the websites will become after collaborations with a great team!  While I have experience working with many different programming languages (all listed in my resum√©) I also have knowledge in working with design tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, and Balsamiq.  I absolutely cannot wait to jump into the corporate world to implement my skills while working alongside outstanding coworkers with a company in Charlotte or the surrounding areas.
